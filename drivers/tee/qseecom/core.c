 * TEE driver for QSEE applications reached over the legacy QSEECOM interface.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Dawid Wróbel <me@dawidwrobel.com>
 *
 * QSEECOM predates smcinvoke and is not GlobalPlatform: an application is
 * named by a string rather than a UUID, and it has no notion of function IDs
 * or typed parameters. A command is simply a buffer the application knows how
 * to parse, sent with a second buffer for it to write its answer into. That
 * maps onto TEE_IOC_INVOKE with two memrefs and nothing else.
 *
 * CAVEAT, and the one part of this most likely to need changing: applications
 * are named by short ASCII strings, and TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION offers a 16-byte
 * UUID. This driver takes the name as the first parameter -- a memref holding
 * a NUL-terminated string -- and requires the UUID field to be zero. That is a
 * deliberate deviation from GlobalPlatform's rules for what open_session
 * parameters mean, which is defensible only because the driver does not claim
 * TEE_GEN_CAP_GP.
 *
 * The alternative considered was deriving a UUID from the name. It was
 * rejected: it would make sessions impossible to correlate with the names TZ,
 * Android's tooling and the firmware itself all use. The remaining
 * alternative -- a QSEECOM-private ioctl -- is new uapi however it is phrased.
 * This is worth settling before anyone builds on the ABI.

 * a carveout. QSEECOM's APP_START instead takes one contiguous buffer -- the
 * .mdt followed by the segment payloads, with an mdt length and a total length
 * -- so the two want different things from the same files. Hence
 * qcom_mdt_read_image(), which keeps the format knowledge next to the rest of
 * it in mdt_loader.c instead of growing a second parser here.
 *
 * The program headers cannot be read as a file layout for this image at all.
 * Taking a real one (Goodix gfenu): segment 0 has p_offset 0, which would
 * overwrite the very ELF and program headers being parsed, and segments 6 and
 * 7 declare the same p_offset and the same p_paddr with different sizes, so
 * placing by p_offset makes one overwrite the other. Concatenation in
 * program-header order is what the vendor's own loader does, and it is what
 * produces an image TZ accepts. Confirmed on hardware rather than inferred:
 * assembling the same files by p_offset, with an identical mdt length, gets
 * the image rejected, while the concatenated form loads.
 *
 * That loading is only reachable on the privileged device *is* the access
 * control. Loading puts an image into the same ID space and the same secure
 * storage machinery as every other application, so it is not something an
 * ordinary client should be able to do, and answering "who may load" with
 * "whoever can open /dev/teepriv0" needs no policy of its own.
